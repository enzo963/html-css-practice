# My HTML & CSS Practice Projects

This repository contains a few simple frontend projects I built to improve my HTML and CSS skills. Each project focuses on a different concept or design style.

## üöÄ Projects

### 1. YouTube Clone (Simple Version)
A basic recreation of the YouTube homepage using only HTML and CSS. Focused on layout, responsiveness, and alignment.

### 2. Stylish Search Box
A modern, animated search bar with clean CSS styling. Designed to be reused in future websites or landing pages.

### 3. Social Media "Add Friend" UI
A component inspired by the friend request feature found in platforms like Facebook and Instagram. It includes buttons, status indicators, and hover effects.
